[Ramp]
# First read to use in ramp (first overall read is 1)
read_0 : 2
# Last read to use, None = use all reads from read_0 onwards
read_f : None
# Subtract reference pixels from each readout channel (strongly recommended)
# Value can be either all, top, bottom, or None
biassub : all
# Factor by which to scale variance from photon noise to account for
# imperfect PSF-lets when estimating errors.  Should give a reduced
# chisq close to 1 in the fitted 2D image.
phnoise : 5

[Calib]
# Location of calibration files
calibdir : calibrations/20160408
# Subtract the background file in calibdir above before extracting a cube?
bgsub : True
# Mask bad pixels using a mask in calibdir?
mask : True

[Extract]
# Spectral resolution for extraction
R : 25
# Method of extraction, lstsq strongly preferred.  Other choice is optext
method : lstsq
# Iterate one time on the least-squares data cube to remove crosstalk?
refine : True
# Mask (set ivar = 0) poor spectral measurements, i.e., those with
# much worse inverse variances than their average neighbors'?  If
# True, the software will replace these intensity measurements with
# interpolated values.  As the measurements are masked anwyay (ivar=0)
# this is purely cosmetic.
smoothandmask : True
# Maximum threads for parallelization.  
# Negative: leave that many threads free.  None: use number of cpus.
maxcpus : None
