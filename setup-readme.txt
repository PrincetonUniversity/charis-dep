required packages:
------------------

numpy (standard for Python > 2.7, other standard libraries will not be mentioned)

Possibly non-standard libraries:
scipy

platform? (not sure if this is in the standard library or not)

At this moment it is believed that the others are standard packages, if others are required above these, please email kyle at kylemede@astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp .  Thanks.
